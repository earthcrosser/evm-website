Far Out SDK for Unity
Bring real space data straight into your games and simulations. Our Far Out SDK wraps the most popular NASA APIs—Astronomy Picture of the Day, Mars Rover photos, Earth imagery, asteroid feeds, EPIC cloud‑free Earth shots, and more—into clean, async C# calls that slot effortlessly into any Unity project.

One‑line setup: drop in the package, paste your NASA API key, you're live.

Ready‑made assets: sample scenes for APOD galleries, Mars‑rover explorers, real‑time asteroid encounters, and dynamic Earth‑orbit shaders.

Editor tools: query, preview, and cache images inside Unity—no browser juggling.

Production‑grade code: UPM‑compatible, IL2CPP‑safe, fully unit‑‑ and play‑tested, with disk caching and graceful rate‑limit handling.

All platforms: 2022 LTS + on desktop, mobile, VR, and (where CORS allows) WebGL.

Turn NASA's public domain imagery and science data into stunning skyboxes, dynamic missions, and educational experiences—in minutes, not weeks. Download the Far Out SDK and launch your players to the stars.
